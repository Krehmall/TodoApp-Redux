## Todo App

In this App I used: [React+Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) ,**HTML+CSS** .
This one was made with ***Redux*** ,which is managing ***States*** and work as database.
I also used ***React Icons*** and ***Router Provider***, and some base hooks like a ***UseState***.
To run this App [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) is required to be installed.



### How to run the App:

* Go to console in app directory enter command `npm i` 
* Then in console enter command `npm run dev` 
* In your browser follow the link that will appear in console
